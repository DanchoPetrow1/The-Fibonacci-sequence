ðŸ“‹ Description

This is a simple implementation of the Fibonacci Sequence, where the number of iterations is provided by the user at runtime.

Iâ€™m aware there are more optimized or complex approaches out there (recursion, memoization, etc.), but I personally prefer this clear and straightforward method. Itâ€™s easier to understand and works just the way I like it.

ðŸ§® What is the Fibonacci Sequence?

The Fibonacci Sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
